\chapter{Recursive Solutions to FOMC}\label{chapter:wfomc}

% TODO (V): Some version of this could become the introduction to the chapter
\paragraph{Abstract.}
First-order model counting (FOMC) is a \#\P-complete computational problem that
asks to count the models of a sentence in first-order logic. Despite being
around for more than a decade, practical FOMC algorithms are still unable to
compute functions as simple as a factorial. We argue that the capabilities of
FOMC algorithms are severely limited by their inability to express arbitrary
recursive computations. To enable arbitrary recursion, we relax the restrictions
that typically accompany domain recursion and generalise circuits used to
express a solution to an FOMC problem to graphs that may contain cycles. To this
end, we enhance the most well-established (weighted) FOMC algorithm ForcLift
with new compilation rules and an algorithm to check whether a recursive call is
feasible. These improvements allow us to find efficient solutions to counting
fundamental structures such as injections and bijections.

% Definition and scope of the topic: FOMC

\emph{First-order model counting} (FOMC) is the problem of computing the number
of models of a sentence in first-order logic given the size(s) of its domain(s)
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}. The main application of FOMC (or, rather,
its \emph{weighted} variant WFOMC) is in probabilistic inference, particularly
for statistical relational models such as Markov logic networks that define
probabilities over sets of objects and relations thereof
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11,DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16}.

Over slightly more than a decade, research on (W)FOMC advanced on both
theoretical and empirical fronts. Several WFOMC algorithms such as ForcLift
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}, probabilistic theorem proving
\citep{DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16}, and L2C \citep{DBLP:conf/kr/KazemiP16}
were developed. More and more classes of formulas were shown to be
\emph{liftable}, i.e., solvable in polynomial time with respect to the size(s)
of the domain(s)
\citep{DBLP:conf/kr/BremenK21,DBLP:conf/nips/KazemiKBP16,DBLP:conf/lics/KuusistoL18,DBLP:journals/jair/Kuzelka21}.
Much of the researchers' attention was devoted to developing efficient solutions
to formulas with up to two variables
\citep{DBLP:conf/uai/BremenK21,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2110-05992}.

% The problem you are to focus on the topic: recursion

However, none of the publicly available (W)FOMC algorithms can efficiently
compute functions as simple as a factorial.\footnote{The problem of computing
  the factorial can be described using two variables and counting quantifiers,
  so it belongs to a fragment of first-order logic which is known to be liftable
  \citep{DBLP:journals/jair/Kuzelka21}.} We claim that this shortcoming is due
to the inability of these algorithms to construct recursive solutions.

% If the problem was faced before, describe the state of the art.

The topic of recursion in the context of WFOMC has been studied before but in
very limited ways. \Citet{DBLP:conf/ilp/BarvinekB0ZK21} use WFOMC to generate
numerical data which is then used to conjecture recurrence relations that
explain that data. \Citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} introduced the idea of
\emph{domain recursion}. Intuitively, domain recursion partitions a domain of
size $n$ into a single explicitly named constant and the remaining domain of
size $n-1$. However, many stringent conditions are enforced to ensure that the
search for a tractable solution always terminates.

% 1) But their code only conjectures stuff on data. My conjectures are
% guaranteed always true. 2) everything has to be expressible in $\mathbf{C}^2$,
% i.e., the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers
% on one domain. 3) They only consider P-recursive functions, which means that,
% e.g., $f(n) = f(n-1)f(n-2)$ would not be allowed.

\todo[inline]{Informally introduce what a compilation rule is.}

\todo[inline]{Vertex or node?}

In this work, we show how new tractable solutions can be found by dispensing
with these restrictions. With additional compilation rules and an algorithm for
checking whether a `recursive call' is possible, ForcLift
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} is adapted to be able to construct
recursive functions that efficiently solve counting problems that used to be
beyond its reach. The main conceptual difference from the original algorithm is
that the input formula is now compiled to a labelled directed graph rather than
a circuit (i.e., cycles are allowed). This idea is illustrated in
\cref{fig:after}. Suppose the original formula $\phi$ depended on a domain of
size $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Domain recursion transforms $\phi$ into a different
formula $\psi$ that depends on a domain of size $n-1$. After some number of
subsequent transformations, the algorithm identifies that a solution to $\psi$
can be constructed in part by finding a solution to a version of $\phi$ where
the domain of size $n$ is replaced by a domain of size $n-1$. Recognising $\phi$
from before, we can add a cycle-forming edge to the graph, which can be
interpreted as function $f$ relying on $f(n-1)$ to compute $f(n)$.

           %    Highlights of the results obtained

In our experiments, we consider variations of the function-counting problem.
These functions vary in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item whether they are full or partial,
  \item whether they are injective/surjective/bijective or not,
  \item and whether the domain and the codomain are the same.
\end{itemize}
Many versions of this problem were previously unsolvable by any available
(W)FOMC algorithm, whereas we can find recursive solutions (that can be
evaluated in polynomial time) to all except one of these problems.

% Possible future enhancements and further work in progress

Further work is necessary to fully automate this new way of computing the
(W)FOMC of a formula. Crane produces a graph which then needs to be transformed
to definitions of (potentially recursive) functions. In some cases, it is
necessary to simplify the algebraic expressions in these definitions (e.g.,
reducing $x-x$ to zero for some expression $x$). Most importantly, the algorithm
only gives us the recursive calls but not the base cases. What makes the problem
of finding these base cases non-trivial is that the number of base cases is not
constant for functions of arity greater than one (i.e., formulas that mention
more than one domain). Nonetheless, these remaining challenges are minuscule
compared to the broader goal of expanding the capabilities of (W)FOMC to new
classes of instances.

\subsection{Notes}

In a way, we're dividing the idea of domain recursion between the IDR and the
Ref nodes, thus also generalising it.

[Insert motivation for smoothing from Section 3.4. of the ForcLift paper.]
Originally, smoothing was (and still is) a two-step process. First, atoms that
are still accounted for in the circuit are propagated upwards. Then, at vertices
of certain types, missing atoms are detected and additional sinks are created to
account for them. If left unchanged, the first step of this process would result
in an infinite loop whenever a cycle is encountered. \Cref{alg:smoothing}
outlines how the first step can be adapted to an arbitrary directed graph.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{First-Order Logic}

In this section, we describe a variation of function-free first-order logic with
equality. For a more complete exposition of first-order logic, see the book by
\citet{DBLP:books/daglib/0023546}.

In first-order logic, an \emph{atom} (i.e., an atomic formula) is either
$t_1 = t_2$ or $P(t_1, \dots, t_n)$ for some predicate $P$ and terms
$(t_i)_{i=1}^n$. Here, $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ is the \emph{arity} of $P$. A
\emph{term} is either a constant or a variable (we also call terms
\emph{arguments}). An atom is \emph{ground} if all of its terms are constants.

A \emph{formula} is a well-formed expression that connects atoms using the
previously described logical operators as well as universal
($\forall x \in D. \phi$) and existential ($\exists x \in D. \phi$) quantifiers.
Here, $x$ is a variable, $D$ is a domain, and $\phi$ is a formula. A variable
occurrence is \emph{bound} if it is within the scope of a quantifier for that
variable, otherwise it is \emph{free}. A formula is a \emph{sentence} if all of
its variable occurrences are bound.\footnote{In the rest of this chapter, all
  formulas in first-order logic are assumed to be sentences.}

\subsubsection{How to Interpret a Sentence}

Let $\phi$ be a sentence. Since each variable in $\phi$ is introduced by a
quantifier, each variable is linked to a unique domain. As is done implicitly in
previous work \citep{DBLP:phd/basesearch/VandenBroeck13}, we make the following
assumption.

\begin{assumption}
  Each constant can be mapped to a domain, and each $n$-ary predicate can be
  mapped to a sequence of $n$ domains such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item ...
    \item ...
  \end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}

First, we assume that each $n$-ary predicate can be associated with a sequence
of $n$ domains, one for each of its terms. Second, we assume that each constant
can be similarly linked to a unique domain. Third, we assume that equality is
only checked between terms that have the same domain.

\todo[inline]{Describe this more formally. Maybe just two rules: whenever two
  terms are compared, they have the same domain, the domain of a term is always
  the same as the $k$-th domain of the predicate.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interpretation
        \begin{itemize}
          \item domains as sets
          \item constants as specific elements of domains (different constant
                names $\implies$ different elements). If the domain is not big
                enough, then the formula is unsat.)
          \item variables (indicated during quantification)
          \item Variables are always uppercase, constants are always lowercase.
          \item predicates are interpreted as relations
        \end{itemize}
  \item models are defined very differently: all combinations of relations that
        satisfy the sentence.
  \item (multiple) (finite) domains (of discourse). This makes, e.g.,
        satisfiability decidable and a FO formula can always be expanded to a
        propositional one.
\end{itemize}

more on first-order logic: \citep{DBLP:books/daglib/0023546}. The MLN paper also
has a description

\subsection{Everything Else}

\paragraph{Things I might need to explain.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item atom, (positive/negative) literal, constant, predicate, variable,
        clause, unit clause, first-order logic
  \item subformula
  \item two parts: compilation and inference (see the slide about workflow:
        before and after).
  \item During inference, there is a domain size map
        $\size\colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{N}_0$.
  \item My formalisation of constraints is more restrictive than the original
        (e.g., in the thesis).
  \item \textsc{Crane/ForcLift} works by always having a formula as input and
        adding nodes to the circuit/FCG that constitute the solution the that
        formula.
  \item $\sqcup$ for both sets and functions
  \item injectivity is similar to the all-different constraint
  \item \textsc{ForcLift}\footnote{\url{https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/drupal/wfomc}}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notation.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We write $\to$ for functions, $\pfun$ for partial functions,
        $\twoheadrightarrowtail$ for bijections, and $\hookrightarrow$ for set
        inclusion. Let $\id$ denote the identity function (on any domain). For
        any function $f$, let $\Imm f$ be the image of $f$.
\end{itemize}

Most of the definitions here are adaptations/formalisations of
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} and the corresponding code.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{domain} is a symbol for a finite set.\footnote{In the context of
    functions, the domain of a function $f$ retains its usual meaning and is
    denoted $\dom(f)$.}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  An \emph{(inequality) constraint} is a pair $(a, b)$, where $a$ is a variable,
  and $b$ is either a variable or a constant.
\end{definition}

\todo[inline]{V: It might be worth emphasising that you are introducing new
  notation in new concepts to provide a metatheory to the existing literature on
  listed reasoning.}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{clause} is a triple $c = (L, C, \delta_c)$, where $L$ is a set of
  literals, $C$ is a set of constraints, and $\delta_c$ is a function that maps
  all variables in $c$ to their domains such that (s.t.) if $(x, y) \in C$ for
  some variables $x$ and $y$, then $\delta_c(x) = \delta_c(y)$. Note that for
  convenience sometimes we write $\delta_c$ for the domain map of $c$ without
  unpacking $c$ into its three constituents.

  Also, let $\Vars$ be a function that maps clauses and sets of literals and
  inequalities to the set of variables contained within. In particular,
  $\Vars(c) \coloneqq \Vars(L) \cup \Vars(C)$.
\end{definition}

A \emph{formula} is a set of clauses. All variables in a clause are implicitly
universally quantified (but note that variables are never shared among clauses),
and all clauses in a formula are implicitly linked by conjunction. This way, one
can read formulas as defined here as sentences in first-order logic.

\todo[inline]{Note: we will reuse this several times.}
\begin{example} \label{example:first} Let $\phi \coloneqq \{\, c_1, c_2 \,\}$ be
  a formula, where
  \[
    c_1 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \,\}),
  \]
  and
  \[
    c_2 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \,\}),
  \]
  for some predicate $p$, variables $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and domains $a$ and $b$. Then
  in first-order logic $\phi$ could be read as
  \begin{align*}
    (\forall X \in a. \forall Y \in b. \forall Z \in b. Y \ne Z &\implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(X, Z)) \land \\
    (\forall X \in a. \forall Y \in b. \forall Z \in a. X \ne Z &\implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(Z, Y)).
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\paragraph{Notation for lists.}
Let $\langle\rangle$ and $\langle x \rangle$ denote an empty list and a list
with one element $x$, respectively. We write $\in$ for (in-order) enumeration,
$\mdoubleplus$ for concatenation, and $|\cdot|$ for the length of a list. Let
$h : t$ denote a list with first element (a.k.a. head) $h$ and remaining list
(a.k.a. tail) $t$. We also use list comprehensions written equivalently to set
comprehensions. For example, let $L \coloneqq \langle 1 \rangle$ and
$M \coloneqq \langle 2 \rangle$ be two lists. Then
$M = \langle 2x \mid x \in L \rangle$,
$L \mdoubleplus M = 1 : \langle 2 \rangle$, and $|M| = 1$.

\section{Methods}

% Generalising Circuits to Labelled Graphs

\todo[inline]{We call an FCG (not an FCG, I need to invent some new name) full
  (complete?) if $L = \langle\rangle$ or, equivalently, there are no $\star$s
  in $G$.}

\paragraph{From circuits to graphs.}
A \emph{first-order deterministic decomposable negation normal form
  computational graph} (FCG) is a (weakly connected) directed graph with a
single source, vertex labels, and ordered outgoing edges.\footnote{Note that
  imposing an ordering on outgoing edges is just a limited version of edge
  labelling.} We denote an FCG as $G = (V, s, N^+, \tau)$, where $V$ is the set
of vertices, and $s \in V$ is the unique source. Also, $N^+$ is the direct
successor function that maps each vertex in $V$ to a \emph{list} that contains
other vertices in $V$.

\paragraph{Node labels.}
Vertex labels consist of two parts: the \emph{type} and the \emph{parameters}.
To avoid clutter, we leave the parameters implicit and let $\tau$ denote the
vertex-labelling function that maps each vertex in $V$ to its type. For each
vertex $v \in V$, the length of list $N^+(v)$ (i.e., the out-degree of $v$) is
determined by its type $\tau(v)$.

\paragraph{Node types.}
Most of the types are as in previous work
\citep{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11,DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}. The type for
non-tree-like edges (denoted by $\Reff$), while used before, is extended to
contain the information necessary to support recursive calls. We also add three
new types:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a type for constraint removal denoted by $\CR$,
  \item a type for GDR denoted by $\GDR$ (both with out-degree one),
  \item and $\star$---a placeholder type (with out-degree zero) for nodes that are going to be replaced.
\end{itemize}

    contradiction---see the work by \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} for the
    descriptions of these node types.}\label{fig:examplefcg}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Drawing an FCG.}
When drawing FCGs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item outgoing edges are ordered from left to right,
  \item node labels are written directly on the nodes,
  \item and irrelevant labels and/or parameters are omitted.
\end{itemize}
For example, the FCG in \cref{fig:examplefcg} has twelve nodes. The source
vertex has out-degree 1 (i.e., $|N^+(s)| = 1$), label
$\GDR_{a \gets a \setminus \{\, x \,\}}$, and type $\GDR$ (i.e.,
$\tau(s) = \GDR$).

\paragraph{Some notational conventions.}
Similarly to previous work \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}, we write $T_p$
for an FCG that has a node with label $T_p$ (i.e., type $T$ and parameter(s)
$p$) and $\star$'s as all of its direct successors. For instance, as an FCG,
$\star$ denotes
$(\{\, s \,\}, s, \{\, s \mapsto \langle\rangle \,\}, \{\, s \mapsto \star \,\})$,
i.e., an FCG with just one node of type $\star$ and no edges. We also write
$T_p(v)$ for an FCG with two vertices and an edge between them (and no edges
incident with $\star$). Here, $v$ is the target of the edge, and $T_p$ is the
label of the source.

\paragraph{Hashing.}
We use (integer-valued) hash functions to efficiently discard pairs of formulas
that are too different for recursion to be established. The hash code of a
clause $c = (L, C, \delta)$ (denoted by $\# c$) combines the hash codes of the
sets of constants and predicates in $c$, the numbers of positive and negative
literals, the number of inequality constraints $|C|$, and the number of
variables $|\Vars(c)|$. The hash code of a formula $\phi$ combines the hash
codes of all its clauses and is denoted by $\#\phi$.

\paragraph{Caching.}
Previously, a cache was used to check if a formula is identical to one of the
formulas that have already been fully compiled. If that is the case, then the
circuit already contains the subcircuit for this formula. Instead of duplicating
this subcircuit, one would draw an edge that creates an undirected (but not a
directed) cycle (see \cref{fig:before}). Now, to facilitate recursion, we extend
the caching scheme to include formulas that have been encountered but not fully
compiled yet. Hence, the same procedure can now create directed cycles in the
graph. Formally, we define a \emph{cache} to be a map from integers (e.g., hash
codes) to sets of pairs of the form $(\phi, v)$, where $\phi$ is a formula, and
$v$ is an FCG node.

A \emph{(compilation) rule} takes a formula and returns a set of $(G, L)$ pairs,
where $G$ is an FCG, and $L$ is a list of formulas such that $|L|$ is equal to
the number of $\star$'s in $G$. Let the \emph{underlying tree} of an FCG $G$ be
the induced subgraph of $G$ that omits all $\Reff$ nodes (subsequently presented
algorithms ensure that it is always a tree). Then we can define an implicit
bijection between the formulas in $L$ and the $\star$'s in $G$ according to the
order in which elements of $L$ are listed and the pre-order traversal of the
underlying tree of $G$. For example, if the FCG in \cref{fig:ordering} were to
be returned by a compilation rule, its corresponding list of formulas $L$ would
have two elements. These elements would then be implicitly associated with the
$\star$'s that have labels `3' and `4' next to them, respectively.

\todo[inline]{if a rule is not applicable to a given formula, it returns an
  empty set and is skipped.}

\todo[inline]{This explanation should be positioned independently of
  compilation rules.}

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all domains. Note that this set expands during
the compilation.

\subsubsection{Generalised Domain Recursion} \label{sec:dr}

\paragraph{Notation.}
Let $S$ be a set of constraints or literals, $V$ a set of variables, and $x$
either a variable or a constant. We write $S[x/V]$ to denote $S$ with all
occurrences of all variables in $V$ replaced with $x$.\footnote{Note that if
  $(v, w)$ is a two-variable constraint, substituting a constant $c$ for $v$
  would result in $(c, w)$, which would have to be rewritten as $(w, c)$ to fit
  the definition of a constraint.} \todo[inline]{Short example?}

\todo[inline,caption={}]{Feedback for the paragraph below:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item introduce the algo in the first sentence: The Domain recursion
          algorithm (Van den Broeck, 2011) takes as input a formula and outputs

          `the intermediate step results in ....'
    \item clarify `original rule'
    \item explain DR before GDR
  \end{itemize}
}

\todo[inline,caption={}]{After a description of the algorithm, compare with the
  original \citep{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11}. Invite the reader to look up the
  original paper for more details. The original rule for domain recursion by
  \citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} requires three conditions to be satisfied:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the formula is shattered,
    \item the formula has no independent subformulas,
    \item and there exists a root binding class.
  \end{itemize}
  Domain recursion by \citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} then splits the...

  \begin{itemize}
    \item They create three sets of clauses instead of just one. They are
          independent and their conjunction is decomposable.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item the part with only variables $v$
            \item the part with only constants $x$
            \item the part with both constants and variables $r$
          \end{itemize}
    \item During evaluation, $v$ is ignored, and the WMCs of $x$ and $r$ can be
          computed independently. Note that the WMC of $x$ is independent of the
          size of $D$---this further simplifies the matters.
  \end{itemize}
}

The main idea of domain recursion (both the original version by
\citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} and the one presented here) is as follows. Let
$d \in \mathcal{D}$ be a domain. Assuming that $d \ne \emptyset$, it can be
partitioned into a singleton set (say, $\{\, x \,\}$) and a set of cardinality
$|d| - 1$. Then, for every variable $X$ associated with domain $d$ that occurs
in a literal, we want to investigate two possibilities: $X = x$ and $X \ne x$.
Note that the total number of such possibilities is not necessarily a power of
two: some combinations produce clearly unsatisfiable formulas that can be
immediately discarded. We can combine all of these possibilities into a single
formula equivalent to the original one. The differences between domain recursion
and GDR are in the preconditions for the rule to be applicable and in how the
resulting formula (or parts thereof) are handled. The original rule ensures that
the remaining formula can be handled efficiently and without the risk of the
search algorithm running forever at the expense of more stringent preconditions.

      } }
    $S \gets S \cup \{\, (\GDR_{d \gets d \setminus \{\, x \,\}}, \langle\phi'\rangle) \,\}$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm for GDR is summarised as \cref{alg:domainrecursion}, and it
features only one precondition. Namely, \cref{line:condition} says that for GDR
to be applicable on domain $d \in \mathcal{D}$, there must be at least one
variable with domain $d$ that is featured in a literal (and not just in
constraints). Without such variables, GDR would have no effect on the formula.

\begin{example}
  Let $\phi = \{\, c_1, c_2 \,\}$ be a formula, where
  \begin{align*}
    c_1 &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Z, Y) \,\}, \{ X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \}), \\
    c_2 &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, X) \,\}, \{ X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \}).
  \end{align*}
  While domain recursion is possible on both domains, here we illustrate how it
  works on $a$. Having chosen a domain, the algorithm iterates over the clauses
  of $\phi$. Suppose \cref{line:forclause} picks $c = c_1$ as the first clause.
  Then, set $V$ is constructed to contain all variables with domain $d = a$ that
  occur in the literals of clause $c$. In this case, $V = \{\, X \,\}$.

  \todo[inline]{What does it mean to generate a clause?}

  \Cref{line:conditions} iterates over all subsets $W \subseteq V$ of variables
  that can be replaced by a constant without resulting in formulas that are
  evidently unsatisfiable. We impose two restrictions on $W$. First,
  $W^2 \cap C = \emptyset$ ensures that there are no pairs of variables in $W$
  that are constrained to be distinct, since that would result in a $x \ne x$
  constraint after substitution. Similarly, we want to avoid variables in $W$
  that have inequality constraints with constants: after substitution, such
  constraints would transform into inequality constraints between two constants.
  In this case, both subsets of $V$ satisfy these conditions, and
  \cref{line:generation} generates two clauses for the output formula:
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Z, Y), (X, x) \,\}, \{ X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \}),
  \]
  (from $W = \emptyset$) and
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(x, Y), \neg p(x, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Z, Y) \,\}, \{ Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \})
  \]
  (from $W = V$).

  When \cref{line:forclause} picks $c = c_2$, then $V = \{\, X, Z \,\}$. The
  subset $W = V$ fails to satisfy the conditions on \cref{line:conditions}
  because of the $Z \ne X$ constraint. The other three subsets of $V$ all
  generate clauses for $\phi'$:
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, X), (X, x), (Z, x) \,\}, \{ X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \})
  \]
  (from $W = \emptyset$),
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(x, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, x) \,\}, \{ Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \})
  \]
  (from $W = \{\, X \,\}$), and
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(x, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, x) \,\}, \{ X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, \})
  \]
  (from $W = \{\, Z \,\}$).
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Constraint Removal} \label{sec:cr}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{The compilation rule for $\CR$ nodes}
  \label{alg:constraintremoval}
  \KwIn{formula $\phi$, set of domains $\mathcal{D}$} \KwOut{set $S$}
  $S \gets \emptyset$\; \ForEach{domain $d \in \mathcal{D}$ and element
    $x \in d$ s.t. $x$ does not occur in any literal of any clause of $\phi$
    {\bf and} for each clause $c = (L, C, \delta_c) \in \phi$ and variable
    $v \in \Vars(c)$, either $\delta_c(v) \ne d$ or
    $(v, x) \in C$\label{line:crconditions}}{ add a new domain $d'$ to
    $\mathcal{D}$\; $\phi' \gets \emptyset$\; \ForEach{clause
      $(L, C, \delta) \in \phi$}{
      $C' \gets \{\, (a, b) \in C \mid b \ne x \,\}$\;\label{line:constraintremoval}
      \nosemic$\delta' \gets v \mapsto \begin{cases} d' & \text{if
        } \delta(v) = d\\ \delta(v) & \text{otherwise;} \end{cases}$\;\label{line:newdelta}
      $\phi' \gets \phi' \cup \{\, (L, C', \delta') \,\}$\; }
    $S \gets S \cup \{\, (\CR_{d \mapsto d'}, \langle\phi'\rangle) \,\}$\; }
\end{algorithm}

Recall that GDR on a domain $d$ creates constraints of the form $X_i \ne x$ for
some constant $x \in d$ and family of variables $X_i \in d$. Once certain
conditions are satisfied, \cref{alg:constraintremoval} can eliminate these
constraints and replace $d$ with a new domain $d'$, which can be interpreted as
$d \setminus \{\, x \,\}$. These conditions (on \cref{line:crconditions} of the
algorithm) are that a constraint of the form $X \ne e$ exists for all variables
$X \in d$ across all clauses, and such constraints are the only place where $e$
occurs. The algorithm then proceeds to construct the new formula by removing
constraints (on \cref{line:constraintremoval}) and constructing a new domain map
$\delta'$ that replaces $d$ with $d'$ (on \cref{line:newdelta}).

\begin{example}
  Let $\phi = \{\, c_1, c_2, c_3 \,\}$ be a formula with clauses
  \begin{align*}
    c_1 &= (\emptyset, \{\, (Y, X) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto b^\top, Y \mapsto b^\top \,\}), \\
    c_2 &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (X, x), (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto b^\bot \,\}), \\
    c_3 &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, x), (Z, X), (Z, x) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto a \,\}).
  \end{align*}
  Domain $a$ and with its element $x \in a$ satisfy the preconditions for
  constraint removal. The rule introduces a new domain $a'$ and transforms
  $\phi$ to $\phi' = (c_1', c_2', c_3')$, where
  \begin{align*}
    c_1' &= c_1 \\
    c_2' &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto b^\bot \,\}) \\
    c_3' &= (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, X) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto a' \,\}).
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Identifying Opportunities for Recursion} \label{sec:ref}

% Notation

\paragraph{Notation.}
First, for partial functions $\alpha, \beta\colon A \pfun B$ s.t.
$\alpha|_{\dom(\alpha) \cap \dom(\beta)} = \beta|_{\dom(\alpha) \cap \dom(\beta)}$,
we write $\alpha \cup \beta$ for the unique partial function s.t.
$\alpha \cup \beta|_{\dom(\alpha)} = \alpha$, and
$\alpha \cup \beta|_{\dom(\beta)} = \beta$. Second, let $\Doms$ be a function
that maps any clause or formula to the set of domains used within. Specifically,
$\Doms(c) \coloneqq \Imm \delta_c$ for any clause $c$, and
$\Doms(\phi) \coloneqq \bigcup_{c \in \phi} \Doms(c)$ for any formula $\phi$.
Third, for any clause $c = (L, C, \delta_c)$, bijection
$\beta\colon \Vars(c) \twoheadrightarrowtail V$ (for some set of variables $V$),
and function $\gamma\colon \Doms(c) \to \mathcal{D}$, let $c[\beta, \gamma] = d$
be the clause $c$ with all occurrences of any variable $v \in \Vars(c)$ in $L$
and $C$ replaced with $\beta(v)$ (so $\Vars(d) = V$) and
$\delta_d\colon V \to \mathcal{D}$ defined as
$\delta_d \coloneqq \gamma \circ \delta_c \circ \beta^{-1}$. In other words,
$\delta_d$ is the unique function that makes
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Vars(c) \ar[r, tail, two heads, "\beta"] \arrow[d, swap, "\delta_c"] & V = \Vars(d) \ar[d, dashed, "\exists!\delta_d"] \\
    \Doms(c) \ar[r, swap, "\gamma"] & \mathcal{D}
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
commute. For example, if clause
\[
  c_1 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \,\})
\]
is as in \cref{example:first}, then
\begin{multline*}
  c_1[\{\, X \mapsto A, Y \mapsto B, Z \mapsto C \,\}, \{\, a \mapsto b, b \mapsto c \,\}] = \\
  (\{\, \neg p(A, B), \neg p(A, C) \,\}, \{\, (B, C) \,\}, \{\, A \mapsto b, B \mapsto c, C \mapsto c \,\}).
\end{multline*}

% Cache $C$ is used to partition all previously-encountered formulas based on
% their hash codes.
\Cref{alg:trycache} describes the compilation rule for creating $\Reff$ nodes.
For every formula $\psi$ s.t. $\#\psi = \#\phi$ that we have encountered so far,
function \texttt{identifyRecursion} is called to check whether a recursive call
is actually feasible. If it is, the function returns a (total) map
$\rho\colon \Doms(\phi) \to \Doms(\psi)$ that shows how $\phi$ can be
transformed into $\psi$ by replacing each domain $d \in \Doms(\phi)$ with
$\rho(d) \in \Doms(\psi)$. Otherwise, \texttt{identifyRecursion} returns
\texttt{null} to signify that $\phi$ and $\psi$ are too different for recursion
to work. This happens if $\phi$ and $\psi$ (or their subformulas explored in
recursive calls) are structurally different (i.e., the numbers of clauses or the
hash codes fail to match) or if a clause of $\phi$ cannot be paired with a
sufficiently similar clause of $\psi$.

Function \texttt{identifyRecursion} iterates over pairs of clauses of $\phi$ and
$\psi$ that have the same hash codes. It uses function \texttt{generateMaps} to
check whether the two clauses are sufficiently similar. If so, the function
calls itself on the remaining clauses until the map
$\rho\colon \Doms(\phi) \to \Doms(\psi)$ becomes total, and all clauses are
successfully coupled.

%% If the bijection makes the clauses equal, and the domain map is compatible
           %%             with previously decided domain mappings, move on to another pair of clauses.

Given two clauses $c \in \phi$ and $d \in \psi$, \texttt{generateMaps} considers
all possible bijections\footnote{Although the number of bijections between two
  sets of cardinality $n$ is $n!$, this part of the algorithm is unlikely to
  cause performance issues for two reasons. First, in practice, $n$ is usually
  at most two or three. Second, due to the manner in which formulas are modified
  by compilation rules, if any bijection results in a successfully identified
  recursive relationship, it is almost always the identity bijection.}
$\beta\colon \Vars(c) \twoheadrightarrowtail \Vars(d)$ and calls
\texttt{constructDomainMap}, which then attempts to construct a map
$\gamma\colon \Doms(c) \to \Doms(d)$ `consistent' with both $\beta$ and (the as
yet partial map) $\rho\colon \Doms(\phi) \pfun \Doms(\psi)$. The \textbf{yield}
keyword in \texttt{generateMaps} works as in programming languages such as C\#,
JavaScript, and Python, and lazily returns a sequence of values, computing each
element of the sequence as needed.

Diagrammatically, \texttt{constructDomainMap} attempts to find a
$\gamma\colon \Doms(c) \to \Doms(d)$ s.t.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:commute}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    V = \Vars(c) \ar[r, tail, two heads, "\beta"] \arrow[d, swap, "\delta_c"] & \Vars(d) \ar[d, "\delta_d"] \\
    \Doms(c) \ar[r, dashed, "\gamma"] \ar[d, hookrightarrow] & \Doms(d) \ar[d, hookrightarrow] \\
    \Doms(\phi) \ar[r, swap, "\rho", "|" marking, outer sep=5pt] & \Doms(\psi).
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
commutes (and returns \texttt{null} if such a function does not exist). Indeed,
for every variable in $V = \Vars(c)$, the function returns \texttt{null} if
either the top rectangle from $V$ to $\Doms(d)$ or the outer rectangle from $V$
to $\Doms(\psi)$ fails to commute. These checks also ensure that
$\rho \cup \gamma$ is possible on \cref{line:recursion} of the algorithm, i.e.,
$\rho|_{\dom(\rho)\cap\dom(\gamma)} = \gamma|_{\dom(\rho)\cap\dom(\gamma)}$.

\begin{example} \label{example}

  % definitions of formulas and intro
  Let formula $\phi \coloneqq \{\, c_1, c_2 \,\}$ be as in \cref{example:first},
  i.e., with
  \[
    c_1 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \,\})
  \]
  and
  \[
    c_2 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \,\}).
  \]
  Let formula
  $\psi \coloneqq \phi[\id, \{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}]$ be just
  like $\phi$ but with different domains. In other words,
  $\psi = \{\, d_1, d_2 \,\}$, where
  \[
    d_1 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto b^\bot \,\}),
  \]
  and
  \[
    d_2 \coloneqq (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, Z) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto a' \,\}).
  \]
  Note that $\#\phi = \#\psi$ and assume that $(\psi, v) \in C(\#\phi)$ for some
  node $v$. We shall see how \cref{alg:trycache} identifies that the FCG for
  $\psi$ can be reused for $\phi$ as well.

  Since both formulas are non-empty, the algorithm proceeds with the for-loops
  on \cref{line:for1,line:for2,line:generateMaps}. Suppose $c = c_1$ and
  $d = d_1$ get picked. Since both clauses have three variables, in the worst
  case, function \texttt{generateMaps} would have $3!=6$ bijections to check.
  Suppose the identity bijection is picked first. Then
  \texttt{constructDomainMap} is called with the following parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $V = \{\, X, Y, Z \,\}$,
    \item $\delta_c = \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto b \,\}$,
    \item
          $\delta_d = \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$,
    \item $\beta = \{\, X \mapsto X, Y \mapsto Y, Z \mapsto Z \,\}$,
    \item $\rho = \emptyset$.
  \end{itemize}
  Since $\delta_c(Y) = \delta_c(Z)$ and $\delta_d(Y) = \delta_d(Z)$,
  \texttt{constructDomainMap} returns
  $\gamma = \{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$. Thus,
  \texttt{generateMaps} yields its first pair of maps $(\beta, \gamma)$ to
  \cref{line:generateMaps}. Furthermore, this pair satisfies
  $c[\beta, \gamma] = d$. On \cref{line:recursion}, a recursive call to
  \texttt{identifyRecursion($\{\,c_2\,\}$, $\{\,d_2\,\}$, $\gamma$)} is made.

  In this subproblem where both formulas are left with a single clause each,
  again we have two non-empty formulas with equal hash codes. Thus
  \texttt{generateMaps} is called with $c = c_2$, $d = d_2$, and
  $\rho = \{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$. Suppose
  \cref{line:bijection} picks the identity bijection gain. Then
  \texttt{constructDomainMap} is called with the following parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $V = \{\, X, Y, Z \,\}$,
    \item $\delta_c = \{\, X \mapsto a, Y \mapsto b, Z \mapsto a \,\}$,
    \item $\delta_d = \{\, X \mapsto a', Y \mapsto b^\bot, Z \mapsto a' \,\}$,
    \item $\beta = \{\, X \mapsto X, Y \mapsto Y, Z \mapsto Z \,\}$,
    \item $\rho = \{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$.
  \end{itemize}
  Since $\beta$ and $\rho$ commute (as in \cref{eq:commute}), and there are no
  new domains in $\Doms(c)$ and $\Doms(d)$, $\gamma$ exists and is equal to
  $\rho$. Again, the returned pair $(\beta, \gamma)$ satisfies
  $c[\beta, \gamma] = d$. \Cref{line:recursion} calls
  \texttt{identifyRecursion($\emptyset$, $\emptyset$, $\rho$)}, which
  immediately returns $\rho = \{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$ as the
  final answer. Therefore, one can indeed reuse an FCG for $\psi$ to compute the
  model count of $\phi$.

% intro
Given a formula $\phi$, we want to find an FCG (or a circuit) that encodes a way
to compute the model count of $\phi$. \textsc{ForcLift} tackles this search
problem using a greedy algorithm.\footnote{The algorithm is not described in any
  paper on \textsc{ForcLift} but can be found in its source code.} In this
section, we describe a new search algorithm---a combination of greedy and
breadth-first search.

% greedy and non-greedy rules
We split all rules into \emph{greedy} and \emph{non-greedy}. Greedy rules
represent indisputable choices in the compilation process. They are applied to
each encountered formula as soon and as many times as possible (in a predefined
order). Most rules are greedy, i.e., those that produce a sink node with no
leftover formula, those that simplify the formula without changing the FCG, and
those that split the formula into parts that can be solved independently. The
constraint removal rule described in \cref{sec:cr} is greedy. On the other hand,
non-greedy rules signify uncertain choices that we may want to retract. They
also correspond to edges in the implicit search tree; thus, the first solution
found by the search algorithm is always the one with fewest applications of
non-greedy rules. These rules include the $\GDR$ and $\Reff$ rules described in
\cref{sec:dr,sec:ref}, respectively, and some rules from previous work
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} such as atom counting, inclusion-exclusion,
independent partial grounding, and shattering.

% states and actions
Search can be conceptualised as traversing a directed graph composed of states
and actions that lead from one state to the next. We define a \emph{state} as a
triple $(G, C, L)$, where $G$ is an FCG, $C$ is a cache, and $L$ is a list of
formulas. The actions that can be taken in such a state are applications of
compilation rules that remove the first formula from $L$ and potentially add
something to $G$, $C$, and $L$. The meaning of $G$, $L$, and the correspondence
between the $\star$'s in $G$ and the formulas in $L$ is the same as in the
definition of a compilation rule at the beginning of \cref{sec:rules}.

\todo[inline]{Will need to update this last sentence to point to the new
  definition.}

The search algorithm is described as
\cref{alg:search,alg:applyallrules,alg:apply,alg:helpers}, with the main
procedure in \cref{alg:search}. Since for most formulas we are able to find
several FCGs (of various complexities), the algorithm maintains set $S$ of found
solutions. We begin by applying all suitable greedy rules on \cref{line:greedy}.
If greedy rules are enough to find a full FCG, the algorithm stops. Otherwise,
\cref{line:q1,line:q2} set up a queue for breadth-first search. The algorithm
continues to take a state from the queue, call \texttt{applyAllRules} on it, and
place the resulting states back on the queue while filtering out full FCGs and
adding them to $S$ instead. Since GDR can be applied to almost all formulas, the
search is infinite. In our implementation, we stop searching when
\begin{itemize}
  \item the desired number of solutions is found,
  \item the search tree reaches a certain height,
  \item or the algorithm times out.
\end{itemize}

Function \texttt{applyAllRules} (see \cref{alg:applyallrules}) takes a state and
generates a sequence of new states created by applying one non-greedy rule
followed by all applicable greedy rules. We assume that the input state contains
at least one formula (otherwise it would be a complete solution) and that all
applicable greedy rules have already been applied. The algorithm iterates over
all non-greedy rules and all pairs of FCGs and lists of formulas generated by
these rules when applied to $\phi$. If the FCG is \texttt{null}, this means that
$|L''| = 1$, and $L''$ contains a modified version of $\phi$---in this case, we
rerun \texttt{applyAllRules} on the same state but with the updated formula.
Otherwise, we update the cache, call another function to apply greedy rules, and
merge $(G'', L'')$ with a copy of the input state. In doing so, $\phi$ is
replaced by $L''$, preserving the implicit bijection between the ordering of the
list and the structure of $\star$'s in the FCG.

\todo[inline]{Describe the two remaining algorithms:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cref{alg:apply}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Introduce \cref{alg:apply}
          \item The first function, \texttt{applyGreedyRules},...
          \item Note: although greedy rules return a set just like non-greedy
                rules, that set contains at most one element.
          \item The second function, \texttt{applyGreedyRulesToFormulas}, runs
                \texttt{applyGreedyRules} on all formulas in $L$, incorporating
                the resulting FCGs (with their corresponding lists of formulas)
                as direct successors of $s$.
          \item The usage of \texttt{applyGreedyRulesToFormulas}: the input FCG
                $(V, s, N^+, \tau)$ and list of formulas $L$ are always:
                \begin{itemize}
                  \item as generated by a compilation rule (without any merging
                        or composite applications of other rules taking place
                        beforehand)
                  \item the FCG has just one non-$\star$ vertex, $s$, and
                        $N^+(s)$ contains exactly $|L|$ $\star$'s.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
  \item \cref{alg:helpers}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \texttt{updCache}: Note that $\Reff$ nodes are not placed in the
                cache because the relation identified by the compilation rule
                for $\Reff$ (i.e., \cref{alg:trycache}) is transitive. In other
                words, instead of calling a function
                $f(\mathbf{n}) \coloneqq g(\mathbf{m})$ (where $\mathbf{n}$ and
                $\mathbf{m}$ are integer parameter vectors, and $\mathbf{m}$ is
                constructed from $\mathbf{n}$), we can always directly call
                function $g$.
          \item \texttt{mergeFcgs}: Note that the initial (i.e., non-recursive)
                call to \texttt{mergeFcgs} will never return \texttt{null}
                because there is going to be at least one $\star$ in $G$, and
                the function will find it.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to Interpret an FCG}

When \textsc{ForcLift} \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} compiles a WFOMC
instance into a circuit, each gate type encodes an arithmetic operation on its
inputs and parameters. These operations are then immediately performed while
traversing the circuit and using domain sizes and weights as the initial inputs.
With \textsc{Crane}, the evaluation of an FCG is a collection of functions. Each
function has (some) domain sizes as parameters and may contain recursive calls
to other functions, including itself. While there may be any number of
subsidiary functions, there is always one main function that can be called with
the sizes of the domains of the input formula as arguments. Henceforth, this
function is always called $f$.

\todo[inline,caption={}]{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation vs interpretation: fix terminology.
    \item Refer to previous work for the evaluations/interpretations of other
          node types and for the definition of groundings. Note that my clause
          is their c-expression or something like that.
    \item Finish writing this paragraph. Here we provide an informal
          description... Formalising this into an algorithm is left for future
          work. We shall see a more detailed example of evaluation in
          \cref{sec:results}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The source node defines $f$.
            \item $\Reff$ evaluates to a function call. The target of the
                  outgoing edge then must introduce a new function, the
                  parameters of which are the sizes of all domains reachable
                  from it.
            \item $\GDR$ node does not have a particular evaluation. However, it
                  is usually the direct successor of a $\Reff$ node.
            \item $\CR$ nodes have no particular evaluation.
            \item Obviously, $\star$ has no evaluation because incomplete FCGs
                  are not meant to be evaluated.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Double check that I didn't mix up the $m$s and $n$s, i.e., be
          consistent with the next section even if both variations are correct.
  \end{itemize}
}

\begin{example}
  Let us use the FCG from \cref{fig:examplefcg} as an example. The input formula
  has two domains: $a$ and $b$. Thus, the interpretation of the FCG is a
  function
  $f\colon \mathbb{N}_{0} \times \mathbb{N}_{0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. Let
  $m \coloneqq |a|$, and $n \coloneqq |b|$. The node labelled
  $\bigvee_{b^{\top} \subseteq b}$ tells us that
  $f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} \square$, where $\square$ is the
  interpretation of the remaining subgraph, and $l$ iterates over all possible
  sizes of $b^{\top}$. Nodes labelled $\land$ correspond to multiplication.
  Therefore, we now know that
  $f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} \clubsuit \times \spadesuit$, where
  $\clubsuit$ is the interpretation of the direct successor with label 1, and
  $\spadesuit$ is the interpretation of the remaining subgraph. Since our focus
  is on \emph{unweighted} model counting, all unit nodes (i.e., nodes with label
  1) are interpreted simply as one. Hence, we can fast-forward our construction
  of $f$ to
  $f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times \diamondsuit \times \heartsuit$,
  where $\diamondsuit$ is the interpretation of the contradiction (i.e., $\bot$)
  node, and $\heartsuit$ is the interpretation of the $\Reff$ node.

  A contradiction node with clause $c$ as a parameter is interpreted as one if
  the clause has groundings and zero otherwise. In this case,
  $c = (\emptyset, \{\, (X, Y) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto b^\top, Y \mapsto b^\top \,\})$,
  which can be read as $\forall X, Y \in b^{\top}\text{,
  }X \ne Y \implies \bot$, i.e., $\forall X, Y \in b^{\top}\text{, }X = Y$. This
  latter sentence is true if and only if $|b^{\top}| < 2$. Therefore, we
  can use the Iverson bracket notation to write $\diamondsuit = [l < 2]$.

  It remains to interpret the $\Reff$ node. Parameter
  $\{\, a \mapsto a', b \mapsto b^\bot \,\}$ tells us that the evaluation of the
  $\Reff$ node should be the same as that of the source node, but with domains
  $a$ and $b$ replaced with $a'$ and $b^{\bot}$, respectively. Domain $a'$ was
  created by a constraint removal rule applied on $a$, so $|a'| = m - 1$. Now
  $b^{\bot} = b \setminus b^{\top}$, and $|b^{\top}| = l$, so
  $|b^{\bot}| = n - l$. Thus, the evaluation of the $\Reff$ node is a recursive
  call to $f(m - 1, n - l)$. Therefore,
  \[
    f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} [l < 2] f(m-1, n-l).
  \]
  In order to use this recursive function to compute the model count of the
  input formula for any domain sizes, one just needs to find the base cases
  $f(0, n)$ and $f(m, 0)$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$.

Let $p$ be a predicate of arity two s.t. the first argument is associated with
domain $a$, and the second argument is associated with domain $b$ (i.e., $p$
represents a relation between sets $a$ and $b$). Then, to restrict all relations
representable by $p$ to just functions from $a$ to $b$, in first-order logic one
might write
\begin{gather}
  \forall X \in a. \forall Y \in b. \forall Z \in b. p(X, Y) \land p(X, Z) \implies Y = Z \label{eq:def1} \\
  \forall X \in a. \exists Y \in b. p(X, Y). \label{eq:def2}
\end{gather}
The former says that one element of $a$ can map to at \emph{most} one element of
$b$, and the latter says that each element of $a$ must map to at \emph{least}
one element of $b$. One might add
\begin{equation} \label{eq:injectivity}
  \forall W \in a. \forall X \in a. \forall Y \in b. p(W, Y) \land p(X, Y) \implies W = X
\end{equation}
to restrict $p$ to injections or
\begin{equation}
  \forall Y \in b. \exists X \in a. p(X, Y)
\end{equation}
to ensure surjectivity or remove \cref{eq:def2} to consider partial functions.
Lastly, one can replace all occurrences of $b$ with $a$ so as to model
endofunctions instead.

  \item Functions, surjections, and their partial counterparts are/were already
        liftable. It seems like lifting injectivity (which is a fairly general
        property) is the main accomplishment. (But this is just the one I
        noticed. There may be many others as well.)
  \item My examples for 1 domain are expressible using 2 variables and counting
        quantifiers, so they're already known to be liftable.
  \item Recursion is guaranteed to terminate if at least one domain shrinks by
        at least one. But note that allowing recursive calls with the same
        domain sizes (e.g., $f(n) = f(n) + \dots$) could be useful because these
        problematic terms might cancel out.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Results.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1d bijections and 1d injections (note that it's the same problem). Depth
        3 solution:
        \begin{align*}
          f(n) &= \sum_{m=0}^n \binom{n}{m} (-1)^{n-m}g(n, m) \\
          g(n, m) &= \sum_{l=0}^n \binom{n}{l}[l < 2]g(n-l, m-1) \\
               &= g(n, m - 1) + ng(n - 1, m - 1),
        \end{align*}
        which works with base case $g(n, 0) = 1$.
  \item 1d partial injections. 2 solutions at depth 6, but they're too
        complicated to check by hand. A contradiction with $X \ne x$ constraints
        makes things complicated.
  \item 2d bijections. Depth 3:
        \begin{align*}
          f(m, n) &= \sum_{l=0}^m \binom{m}{l} [l < 2] (1 - [l < 1])f(m-l, n-1) \\
                  &= mf(m-1, n-1),
        \end{align*}
        which works with base cases $f(0, 0) = 1$, $f(0, n) = 0$, $f(m, 0) = 0$.
  \item 2d injections. Depth 2:
        \begin{align*}
          f(m, n) &= \sum_{l=0}^m \binom{m}{l}[l<2]f(m-l, n-1) \\
                  &= f(m, n-1) + mf(m-1, n-1),
        \end{align*}
        which works with base cases $f(0, 0) = 1$ and $f(m, 0) = 0$.
  \item 2d partial injections, depth 2. Exactly the same circuit as above but
        with base case $f(m, 0) = 1$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\paragraph{Future work.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transform FCGs to definitions of (possibly recursive) functions on
        integers. Use a computer algebra system to simplify them.
  \item Design an algorithm to infer the necessary base cases. (Note that there
        can be an infinite amount of them when functions have more than one
        parameter.)
  \item Observation: -1 (and powers thereof) appear in every solution to a
        formula if and only if the formula has existential quantification.
        That's not very smart! By classifying unit propagation as a greedy rule,
        these powers are pushed to the outer layers of the solution (i.e.,
        `early' in the FCG). It's likely that removing this restriction would
        enable the algorithm to find asymptotically optimal solutions.
\end{itemize}
