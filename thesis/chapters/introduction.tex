\item Testing algorithms across a wide range of problem instances is crucial to ensure the validity of any claim about one algorithm's superiority over another. However, when it comes to inference algorithms for probabilistic logic programs, experimental evaluations are limited to only a few programs. Existing methods to generate random logic programs are limited to propositional programs and often impose stringent syntactic restrictions. We present a novel approach to generating random logic programs and random probabilistic logic programs using constraint programming, introducing a new constraint to control the independence structure of the underlying probability distribution. We also provide a combinatorial argument for the correctness of the model, show how the model scales with parameter values, and use the model to compare probabilistic inference algorithms across a range of synthetic problems. Our model allows inference algorithm developers to evaluate and compare the algorithms across a wide range of instances, providing a detailed picture of their (comparative) strengths and weaknesses.
\item Weighted model counting (WMC) has emerged as the unifying inference mechanism across many (probabilistic) domains. Encoding an inference problem as an instance of WMC typically necessitates adding extra literals and clauses. This is partly so because the predominant definition of WMC assigns weights to models based on weights on literals, and this severely restricts what probability distributions can be represented. We develop a measure-theoretic perspective on WMC and propose a way to encode conditional weights on literals analogously to conditional probabilities. This representation can be as succinct as standard WMC with weights on literals but can also expand as needed to represent probability distributions with less structure. To demonstrate the performance benefits of conditional weights over the addition of extra literals, we develop a new WMC encoding for Bayesian networks and adapt a state-of-the-art WMC algorithm \textsf{ADDMC} to the new format. Our experiments show that the new encoding significantly improves the performance of the algorithm on most benchmark instances.
\item Weighted model counting (WMC) is a powerful computational technique for a variety of problems, especially commonly used for probabilistic inference. However, the standard definition of WMC that puts weights on literals often necessitates WMC encodings to include additional variables and clauses just so each weight can be attached to a literal. This paper complements previous work by considering WMC instances in their full generality and using recent state-of-the-art WMC techniques based on pseudo-Boolean function manipulation, competitive with the more traditional WMC algorithms based on knowledge compilation and backtracking search. We present an algorithm that transforms WMC instances into a format based on pseudo-Boolean functions while eliminating around \SI{43}{\percent} of variables on average across various Bayesian network encodings. Moreover, we identify sufficient conditions for such a variable removal to be possible. Our experiments show significant improvement in WMC-based Bayesian network inference, outperforming the current state of the art.
