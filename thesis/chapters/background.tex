\section{Logic}

This section describes the terminology of formal logic that is used throughout the thesis. We begin with propositional logic, then cover first-order logic in \cref{sec:fologic} and logic-based computational problems and their applications in \cref{sec:logicproblems}. See the book by \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0029942} for a more detailed introduction to logic in the context of computer science.

An \emph{atomic proposition} (\emph{atom} for short) is a Boolean/logical variable with two possible \emph{truth} values: true and false. Unless specified otherwise, we will refer to atoms as \emph{variables}. A \emph{formula} is any well-formed expression that connects variables using the following Boolean/logical operators: negation ($\neg$), disjunction ($\lor$), conjunction ($\land$), (material) implication ($\Rightarrow$), and equivalence (i.e., material biconditional) ($\Leftrightarrow$). A \emph{literal} is either a variable or its negation, respectively called \emph{positive} and \emph{negative} literal. A \emph{clause} is a disjunction of literals.\footnote{In the context of logic programs, the word \emph{clause} is used differently (see \cref{sec:lp,chapter:randomlps}).} A formula is in \emph{conjunctive normal form} (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses, and it is in $k$-CNF if every clause has exactly $k$ literals. Many other normal forms and ways to represent propositional formulas are covered in \cref{sec:kc}.

An \emph{interpretation} of a formula $\phi$ is a map from the variables of $\phi$ to the set $\{\, \text{true}, \text{false} \,\}$. A \emph{model} is an interpretation under which $\phi$ evaluates to true. A formula is \emph{satisfiable} if it has at least one model.

Throughout the thesis, we use set-theoretic notation for many concepts in logic such as clauses and formulas in CNF (e.g., we write $c \in \phi$ to mean that clause $c$ is one of the clauses of formula $\phi$). However, this does not automatically mean that we assume no duplicates---whether or not that is the case is clarified on a case-by-case basis.

% interpretation, model, satisfiable
\begin{example}
  Formula $\phi \coloneqq (\neg a \lor b) \land a$ has two variables $a$ and $b$, is in CNF, and contains two clauses. The first clause $\neg a \lor b$ has a negative literal $\neg a$ and a positive literal $b$. Since $\phi$ has two variables, it also has four interpretations. Interpretation $\{\, a \mapsto \text{true}, b \mapsto \text{true} \,\}$ is a model, so $\phi$ is satisfiable. An equivalent set-theoretic representation of $\phi$ is $\{\, \{\, \neg a, b \,\}, \{\, a \,\} \,\}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{First-Order Logic} \label{sec:fologic}

\begin{itemize}
\item function-free throughout
\item equality
\item predicate, arity
\item atom, how atoms replace variables
\item constant
\item variables
\item A \emph{term} is either a variable or a constant, and an \emph{atom} is a predicate of arity $n$ applied to $n$ terms.
\item domain (of discourse). always consider finite domains (as in Guy's thesis, Friedman et al. 1999, Richardson and Domingos 2006). This makes, e.g., satisfiability decidable and a FO formula can always be extended to a propositional one.
\item existential, universal quantification
\item ground (atom, etc.)
