\chapter{Background}

\paragraph{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describing WMC in this chapter is probably redundant because the introduction will describe it informally and too many chapters re-explain it.
\item Info about inference algorithms (including the ProbLog-specific ones) and where WMC, WFOMC, and ForcLift fit in might be best left scattered across several sections.
\end{itemize}
