\section{Introduction}
% Research Topic: What is the problem? Why is it interesting? What has already
% been done by other people to address it? Why are these existing approaches /
% solutions inadequate?
% The literature review produced earlier in the year could be included as a
% section or as an appendix as part of the answer to the "What has already been
% done by other people?" question.
% Research Topic and Approach: Is the topic well-defined and focussed? Is it
% interesting and timely? Does it suit the student's abilities / background /
% inclinations? Is it likely to lead to an acceptable PhD thesis (making an
% original contribution to knowledge etc.)? Does the student have a good grasp
% of the topic area? Is the proposed approach to the topic appropriate and
% promising?

\section{Work Plan}
% Your Approach: What new approach / angle / idea are you proposing to pursue?
% Why does it seem promising?
% Your Plan: What are the sub-goals that need to be achieved? What is your
% planned order of attack, and how long do you expect each task to take? Does
% the schedule make it plausible that you will achieve the required work within
% the prescribed period of the PhD programme?  And what are the risks in this
% plan and how will you address them (contingency plans)?
% Plan and Resources: Is there an explicit plan, at an appropriate level of
% detail? Is the plan appropriate, realistic, and achievable? Are risks
% identified and do contingency plans seem appropriate? Are the resources
% required to carry out the plan available? If some required resources are not
% currently available, are they guaranteed to be available in time? Is any
% further training required?

\section{Progress}
% A section on the work achieved so far in executing that proposal.
% For example: production and study of a substantial example; design, running
% and analysis of a preliminary experiment; design and perhaps partial
% implementation of a system; main definitions of a theory completed with some
% of their properties established.
% This part of the document should include a description of how this work is
% relevant to the thesis proposal (i.e., to part 1).
% Progress and Related Work/Approaches: Is the quality and quantity of progress
% so far adequate (bearing in mind how specific the studentâ€™s proposal was
% before they entered the programme)? Do results so far look encouraging? Is
% there relevant work and/or alternative approaches that the student should
% consider?
