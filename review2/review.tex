\section{Progress To Date} \label{sec:progress}

In this section, the progress made throughout this academic year is described
with respect to the work plan from my first year review.\footnote{The first year
review (with its own appendices) is included as \cref{app:previous}.}

\begin{description}
\item[WP 1] (`On the Equivalence of Constants in Relational Knowledge Bases')
  was abandoned. While trying to take reviewer feedback into consideration as
  well as update and strengthen the paper, I found an important ambiguity: when
  defining what constants are `captured' and `transferred' by a clause, I fail
  to specify whether each relevant `spot' is occupied by a constant or a
  variable. In the former case, that makes the main theorem of the paper
  completely trivial. While in the latter case, the theorem becomes incorrect. I
  spent a couple of weeks looking for ways to transform the paper into something
  both correct and valuable. The best idea I could find was to use the
  perspective from this paper in the context of inductive logic programming;
  however, I did not want to explore this direction further.
\item[WP 2] (`Generating Random Logic Programs Using Constraint
  Programming') was revised to include an experimental comparison of ProbLog
  inference algorithms and published and presented in CP~2020 (see \cref{app:cp}
  for the camera-ready version). I also gave three more talks about it:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item at the local AIAI seminar,
  \item for the Formal Analysis, Theory and Algorithms research section at the
    University of Glasgow,
  \item and at the FMAI~2021 workshop.
  \end{itemize}
\item[WP 3] was completed in full, although the emphasis shifted more towards
  experimental results than theory. It was first (unsuccessfully) submitted to
  AAAI~2021. Based on reviewer feedback, I updated the experimental section to
  compare not just various encodings with the same algorithm but also all of the
  encodings with the algorithms used in the original papers. The updated version
  can be found in \cref{app:uai} and was submitted to UAI~2021. I was also
  invited to the program committee for this conference.
\item[WP 4] was abandoned due to lack of contributions that could be made.
  Indeed, any contribution would have to be theoretical, empirical, or
  interpretability-related. Significant theoretical contributions are unlikely
  because the theory of abstractions has already been explored before without
  leaving behind any big unanswered questions \cite{DBLP:journals/kbs/Belle20}.
  While previous work could be rephrased in a simpler way and extended with more
  detail, the contributions would still be marginal.

  Furthermore, considering abstractions at their full level of generality is
  unlikely to be a viable method for improving inference speed because any
  abstraction is likely to be more computationally expensive than inference.
  Moreover, previous work on preprocessing for WMC left the field in an
  uncomfortable situation: preprocessing techniques for WMC were identified and
  described in a paper \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/LagniezM14} whose main focus is on
  model counting; and the closed-source implementation of those techniques is
  unsuitable for WMC.

  Finally, a substantial issue with considering abstraction as a tool for
  interpretability---especially in the context of probabilistic relational
  models---is that the low-level building blocks such as predicate and constant
  names are usually semantically meaningful. Thus, replacing such a model with a
  simpler alternative that instead uses high-level concepts that are unlikely to
  correspond to words in any natural language is unlikely to improve
  interpretability despite the potential simplicity of this type of abstraction.
\item Furthermore, a new paper (not covered in the previous annual report) was
  written and submitted to SAT~2021 (see \cref{app:sat}). It originated as an
  attempt to improve \textbf{WP 3}: while the experimental results were
  impressive in the initial version of the paper, adding other algorithms
  revealed that instead of improving the state of the art by two orders of
  magnitude as originally thought, the suggested encoding was only fixing an
  underperforming algorithm and making its performance in line with other
  algorithms. The algorithm used for these experiments (ADDMC) was published
  only last year \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/DudekPV20} and its experimental study
  includes some of the data used in my experiments as well as some new
  instances---one has to wonder whether the latter were added to improve the
  algorithm's comparative performance.

  First, my new paper replaces the previously used algorithm with its even newer
  version DPMC \cite{DBLP:conf/cp/DudekPV20}. The main improvement over ADDMC
  comes from the use of approximately-minimal-treewidth tree decompositions
  instead of heuristics for planning the order of multiplication and projection
  operations. After checking that DPMC performs very similarly with all
  encodings (including my own) and similarly to other WMC algorithms, the need
  to shift the contribution of my paper elsewhere became apparent.

  The main advantage of the encoding I proposed earlier was that it avoided
  parameter variables---something I claimed is completely unnecessary at
  least in WMC algorithms based on algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) (i.e., a
  representation of pseudo-Boolean functions). However, the encoding was
  particularly rigid in that it always compiled each conditional probability
  table (CPT) in a Bayesian network into an ADD before doing anything else.
  Although this resulted in great inference speed improvements on some
  instances, e.g., when most of the probabilities in a CPT are equal, there is
  no reason to believe that such an approach is always optimal. Being unable to
  suggest a new encoding that clearly outperforms others, I decided to
  investigate how parameter variables could be removed from already-existing
  encodings. This led to a generalisation of WMC based on pseudo-Boolean
  functions that I named pseudo-Boolean projection (PBP). I then show how any
  WMC instance can be transformed into a PBP instance and identify conditions
  under which such a transformation can remove parameter variables. This
  transformation is applicable to four out of the five WMC encodings for
  Bayesian networks. Finally, experiments showed that (at least for some
  encodings) parameter variable removal can significantly improve inference
  speed and supersede the previous state of the art.
\end{description}

\section{Future Goals} \label{sec:future}

% TODO: introduction
% TODO: estimate duration

\subsection{Parameterized Complexity of WMC in Theory and
  Practice} \label{sec:1}

The experiments in my papers in \cref{app:uai,app:sat} as well as in previous
work by others \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/DudekPV20,DBLP:conf/cp/DudekPV20}
demonstrate that the differences amongst WMC algorithms are poorly understood,
i.e., the algorithms perform very similarly overall, but with significant
differences on subsets of benchmark data. In other words, which algorithm is the
best depends entirely on who provides the data, and we have no idea what
properties of a WMC instance make it more suitable for a search-based,
a compilation-based, or an ADD-based approach. Therefore, the paper I am working
on now aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish the parameterized complexity of DPMC, showing that it scales
  worse (than other algorithms) with respect to the treewidth of the primal
  graph of the input propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) (we
  call this \emph{primal treewidth}).
\item Propose a new random model for CNF formulas that allows us to generate
  instances of varying primal treewidth and use it to experimentally show how
  the performance of WMC algorithms depends on various properties of the
  instance such as density, primal treewidth, and the proportion of literal
  weights that are particularly `simplifying', e.g., zero, one, and perhaps a
  half.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Risks and contingencies.} One risk that I have already encountered is
that having all of the following can lead to an infeasible amount of computation
time:
\begin{itemize}
\item a time limit that is both similar to the time limits used in other
  experimental studies and provides enough `space' for a growth curve to express
  itself,
\item enough different parameter values so that the plots look more like the
  beautiful and barely-pixelated plots of today (e.g.,
  \cite{DBLP:conf/cp/McCreeshPP19,DBLP:journals/jair/McCreeshPST18}) and less
  like my tiny experimental setup in \cref{app:cp},
\item enough different random instances for each combination of parameter values
  so that a reliable median can be observed despite high variance.
\end{itemize}
This risk has been addressed in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The time limit was reduced to \SI{100}{\second} and could be reduced
  further (e.g., a similar paper uses only a \SI{10}{\second} time limit
  \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/DudekMV17}).
\item Instead of iterating over the values of all parameters in one big
  experiment, I split it into two smaller experiments where some variables are
  held constant and others are allowed to vary.
\end{itemize}
Another risk is that the experimental results may be unclear and/or not easily
explainable. However, as random WMC instance generation is a completely
unexplored area, even weird or imperfect results still count as valuable and
interesting. Moreover, any unexpected differences in the way the algorithms
perform on random and real data can always be likened to the equivalent
situation with SAT algorithms.

\subsection{Weighted Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting} \label{sec:2}

\Cref{app:uai} and partially \cref{app:sat} address one issue with the
traditional definition of WMC, i.e., that restricting weights to literals leads
to most measures being unrepresentable without the addition of more variables
and clauses. It would be thematic to end the thesis by addressing the other
issue: at least for solvers such as ADDMC \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/DudekPV20} and
DPMC \cite{DBLP:conf/cp/DudekPV20}, there is no reason for a clause to be just a
clause, i.e., a disjunction of literals. Instead, it can be an arbitrary
pseudo-Boolean function. In \cref{app:sat}, I suggested that two-valued
pseudo-Boolean function are particularly convenient because they can be defined
with a formal equivalent of the statement `if formula $\phi$ is satisfied, then
the value is $p$, otherwise the value is $q$'. Moreover, there is no reason for
the formula to be propositional! Instead, we can consider \emph{pseudo-Boolean
  constraints}, i.e., an intermediary between SAT and constraint satisfaction
problems that supports linear and multilinear inequality constraints on logical
variables that are interpreted as ones and zeros. Perhaps one can even use these
constraints to encode almost arbitrary arithmetic constraints on integers.

Extending DPMC to support such constraints is unlikely to be difficult. The
challenge is in finding at least one suitable application. The kind of Bayesian
network encodings that I investigated in \cref{app:uai,app:sat} \emph{can}
benefit from this (as they have counting constraints) but only marginally since
each counting constraint is usually only applied to two or three variables.
There must be some domain where probabilistic (or some other kind of weighted)
inference is needed in the context of integer arithmetic, counting, or
knapsack-style constraints, but so far I was not able to find one.

\paragraph{Risks and contingencies.} If I am unable to find a good
application,...
